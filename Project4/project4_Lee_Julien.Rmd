Research Question: 
How does the number of FEMA declared disasters in a county correlate with time (in years)?

Data Generating Process: 
We assume the number of disasters Y at time t follows a Poisson distribution: Y∼Poisson(λ), where λ = exp⁡(β0+β1t,) t =
year (centered or scaled as needed), λ = expected number of disasters
β0,β1 are fixed model parameters

Assumptions:
Disaster counts are conditionally independent 
Poisson variance equals the mean: Var(Y)=E[Y] 
Linear log-mean function of time

Estimates: 
The regression coefficient β1, indicating the effect of time
on disaster rates 
The mean number of disasters per year 
The performance of MLE under repeated sampling 
Bias: Bias(β1_hat) = E[β1_hat]−β1
Variance: Var(β1_hat) MSE: MSE(β1_hat)=Bias\^2+Var

Hypothesis:
If β1>0, disasters increase over time MLE will provide consistent estimates of β1 across simulations

Performance Criteria Assess: 
Mean and standard deviation of β1_hat
Confidence interval coverage (e.g., how often 95% CI contains the true β1) 
MSE of β1_hat

Simulation Plan 
Set parameters: β0=log⁡(2),β1=.05
Simulate disaster counts for T=30 years 
Repeat simulation N=1000 times 
Fit Poisson regression for each simulated dataset 
Record β1_hat, CI bounds, predicted counts

Anticipated Challenges or Limitations 
Overdispersion: Real disaster data may violate Poisson assumptions (variance \> mean) 
Runtime: Fitting 1000 GLMs may take too much time
Small sample variability: With only 30 time points per simulation, estimates may vary a lot
